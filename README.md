# Zomato_Analysis_Power_BI_Dashboard_Project
In this endeavor, I have conducted data extraction, cleaning, and analysis from Zomato, a prominent online food delivery and restaurant exploration platform. Leveraging Zomato's API capabilities, I systematically acquired comprehensive datasets comprising restaurant particulars, user feedback, ratings, and additional information.

**Data Extraction and Cleaning:** Accessed Zomato's API to extract comprehensive datasets and meticulously cleaned the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

**Data Transformation and Modeling:** Designed a robust data model in Power BI, incorporating relationships between different entities such as restaurants, cuisines, and user reviews. Implemented advanced data transformation techniques to derive actionable insights.

**Visualization and Reporting:** Created visually stunning reports and dashboards using Power BI's intuitive interface. From dynamic maps showcasing restaurant locations to sentiment analysis of user reviews, each visualization was crafted to deliver valuable insights at a glance.

**Trend Analysis and Predictive Insights:** Delved deep into the data to uncover trends in cuisine preferences, restaurant popularity, and user behavior. Leveraged predictive analytics to forecast future trends and make data-driven recommendations.

**Outcome:** The project culminated in a comprehensive set of reports and dashboards that provide Zomato stakeholders with actionable insights into various aspects of the platform's performance. From identifying emerging food trends to optimizing restaurant recommendations, these insights empower decision-makers to drive growth and enhance user experience.
